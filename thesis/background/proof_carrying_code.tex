\subsection{Proof Carrying Code}
\label{subsec:proof_carrying_code}

Will cover learning objective ``Explain what Proof Carrying Code is and explain the architecture behind''.

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Code consumer vs. code producer.
\item VC and VCGen
  \item Architecture with VCGen ensures proof is tamper-proof, as VC are extracted by proof checker.
\end{itemize}
