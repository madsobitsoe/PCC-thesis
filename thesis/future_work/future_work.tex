\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future_work}

\begin{itemize}
\item Extending Featherweight eBPF to cover all instructions in eBPF, including 8-, 16- and 32-bit operations, both signed and unsigned. 
\item Extending Featherweight eBPF memory operations to support the stack.
\item Extending Featherweight eBPF memory operations to include pointer arithmetic. (Pointer-scalar arithmetic, not pointer-pointer.)
\item Extending Featherweight eBPF to support kernel-helper functions.
\end{itemize}
