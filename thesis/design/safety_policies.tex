\subsection{Safety Policies}
\label{subsec:safety_policies}

\begin{itemize}
\item No divide by zero. (Not in the verifier)
\item Memory safety for context reads.
\item Memory safety for stack reads and writes.
\item ``safe'' use of uninitialized registers, such as \texttt{xor r0, r0} to set \texttt{r0 = 0}. Common patterns from x86\_64 assembly that are easy to verify safe but explicitly not allowed in eBPF.
  (Not sure if this is a safety policy - or can be formulated as one.)
\item Program termination. (Maybe). \newline
  Though ``termination'', i.e. the DAG-analysis performed by the verifier seems an obvious candidate, it is trivial as long as FW-eBPF does not include jumps or branching.

\end{itemize}
