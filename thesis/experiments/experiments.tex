\subsection{Reproducibility}
\label{subsec:reproducibility}


All experiments have been performed on Linux kernel 6.0.12, with the kernel parameter \\ \verb!kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled! set to 0, allowing a normal unprivileged user to load eBPF program of the socket filter type. 

I have used the \verb!get-lfsc-checker.sh! script to install \texttt{lfsccc} and the accompanying script \verb!lfsc-check.sh!, which has been used to check the proofs generated by \texttt{CVC5}. I can not at the time of writing find the script available online, but have included the script in the zip-file with code accompanying this report.
To reproduce the experiments, it should be sufficient to have a Linux system supporting the \texttt{bpf} syscall, a user with an appropriate privilege level, the CVC5 SMT theorem prover and a haskell build system capable of building the FeBPFVCGen application. A recently updated version of \texttt{stack} should work without problems.
