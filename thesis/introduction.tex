\begin{itemize}
\item Definition of the Featherweight eBPF language, for representing a subset of eBPF that is easier to work with in the context of proof carrying code.
\item A prototype implementation of a verification condition generator for Featherweight eBPF.
\item A small collection of synthetic programs for Featherweight eBPF.
\item A small framework for comparing the capabalities of weakest precondition verification condition generation for Featherweight eBPF in conjunction with the CVC5 SMT theorem prover and the LFSC proof checker to those of the in-kernel eBPF verifier.
\end{itemize}
