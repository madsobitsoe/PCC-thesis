\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Crash course in the linux kernel architecture (brief)}
\label{subsec:crash_course_in_the_linux_kernel_architecture_(brief)}
Brief section giving a quick overview of the possibilities of extending the linux kernel, i.e. new kernel, new module or eBPF.


\subsection{eBPF Subsystem}
\label{subsec:ebpf_subsystem}
Will cover learning objective ``Explain the eBPF subsystem, in particular the machine- and programmign model''.

\subsubsection{eBPF Machine Model}
\subsubsection{eBPF Programming Model}
\subsubsection{eBPF Verifier - actions and guarantees}
Will cover learning objective ``Explain the functionality of the eBPF verifier and what it guarantees''.
Will cover learning objective ``Analyze and identify problems related to untrusted code (and sandboxing?)''
\subsection{Proof Carrying Code}
\label{subsec:proof_carrying_code}

Will cover learning objective ``Explain what Proof Carrying Code is and explain the architecture behind''.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

Will cover learning objective ``Modify and extend the linux kernel, in particular the eBPF subsystem.''
Will cover learning objective ``Write C-code for the linux kernel adhering to current guidelines and standards.''
